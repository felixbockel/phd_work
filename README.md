# PhD topic: Penil bulb sparing and adaptive radiotherapy of prostate cancer patients 

## Abstract

Patients diagnosed with intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer were treated at the University Hospital in Erlangen between July 2015 and September 2016. CT imaging is gold standard in conventional radiotherapy. Additional imaging such as the acquisition of MRI enhances the visibility of nearby soft tissue (penile bulb). The aim was to analyse the penile bulb dose sparing with CT- and MRI-based contours. The results of the dose accumulation of external radiotherapy and brachytherapy indicated a reduced risk of radiation-induced erectile dysfunction with contours based on MRI imaging. Furthermore, the dosimetric impact of the clinical PTV was determined retrospectively influenced by inter- and intrafractional uncertainties of patient positioning and prostate motion. The clinical used margin with expansions of 15mm in LR (left-right) and SI (superior-inferior) and 5â€“10mm in AP (anterior-posterior) was sufficient to cover inter- and intrafractional uncertainties. Lastly, the effect of adaptive radiotherapy in radiotherapy was addressed. Thereby, CBCTs along with fluoroscopic images were considered over the first treatment days to get a better understanding how well fiducial markers, endorectal balloon and anterior rectal wall were correlating with each other during patient setup. If the fiducial markers, endorectal balloon and anterior rectal wall were experiencing a major offset from planning CT, a new planning CT, an adapted set of contours, and an adapted treatment plan followed. The adaptive process revealed a drop of systematic and random errors in LR and SI directions.

## Code

All MRI images acquired using a specific MR protocol and were analysed fully automated. The scripts were written in Matlab. 

1) main code is called matlab_mri_qa_main
2) all other matlab scripts are functions that are used in the main
